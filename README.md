## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am backend developer specializing in Laravel, focusing on building robust server-side applications and managing databases efficiently. I work on tasks like creating and validating models, managing relationships between entities, handling middleware, and developing features that may or may not rely on JavaScript, depending on the project's requirements. I also have experience with Laravel Breeze, Blade templates, and other Laravel features, ensuring smooth functionality and secure, well-structured applications.
